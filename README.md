# A Google Meet Bot Configured Specifically For AACPS Online Schedule
## Usage (Still needs testing)
Pull this repo. Install all dependencies. Run "python meetbot.py". Fill out the database. Run the bot.
## Possible Future Implementations
Access Google Meet CC and search for name. When name is recorded act accordingly. Connect to Arduino??? Let me know what I should do
